## Build Notes

* To save time I made use of Inquirer to simplify handling user input from the terminal. It would be instructive to attempt a build that uses no libraries.
* It would be instructive to develep a computer opponent. The basic version could play by selecting an available tile randomly.
* Implement a browser based GUI
* Implement online play with another player on a different computer (websocket?)
