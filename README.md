# Tic tac toe 
Play tic tac toe against a human player in the terminal.

Build notes:

* This took roughly 6 hours to plan, code, and debug. This was my first attempt at making this game in any format.
* To save time I made use of Inquirer to simplify handling user input from the terminal. It would be instructive to attempt a build that uses no libraries.
* It would be instructive to develep a computer opponent. The basic version could play by selecting an available tile randomly.
* Implement a browser based GUI
* Implement online play with another player on a different computer (websocket?)
